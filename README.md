The available emitter implementations are:

    - `Narrowspark\HttpEmitter\SapiEmitter`
    - `Narrowspark\HttpEmitter\SapiStreamEmitter`.
> **Note:** Each use the native PHP functions `header()` and ```echo``` in order to emit the response.

> Note: If headers have been sent, or the output buffer exists and has a non-zero length, the emitters raise an exception, as mixed PSR-7 / output buffer content creates a blocking issue.
>
> If you are emitting content via `echo`, `print`, `var_dump`, etc., or not catching PHP errors / exceptions, you will need to either fix your application to always work with a PSR-7 response.
> Or provide your own emitters that allow mixed output mechanisms.

Installation
------------

```bash
composer require narrowspark/http-emitter
```

Use
------------

How to use the SapiEmitter:

```php
<?php

use Narrowspark\HttpEmitter\SapiEmitter;

$response = new \Response();
$response->getBody()->write("some content\n");

$emitter = new SapiEmitter();
$emitter->emit($response);
```

If you missing the ```Content-Length``` header you can use the `\Narrowspark\HttpEmitter\Util\Util::injectContentLength` static method.

```php
<?php

use Narrowspark\HttpEmitter\Util;

$response = new \Response();

$response = Util::injectContentLength($response);
```
